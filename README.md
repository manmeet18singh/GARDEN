# GARDEN
## The Product:

Our project is designed to be an intuitive, helpful phone app for both professional landscapers and DIY home projects. GARDEN is an augmented reality app that allows users to place home, garden, and other objects into their local environment. The objective is to help with outdoor design, allowing users to get an idea of what something will look like in their environment before purchasing and installing it. GARDEN is also designed to help with the actual installation process, providing measurements for an area as well as direct links to purchase similar items at the lowest price range from local stores. Whether a backyard project or city design, GARDEN is made to assist with envisioning and implementing outdoor designs. 

## Our Users:

GARDEN is available for everyone to use as it is available for Android and IOS users. Our primary focus is on people that are interested in planning out their garden or a park. We decided users that have a smaller project would require less resources than someone that has a larger project. So we gave users a select screen at the start of the app. A potential user has the option to choose between different project levels. GARDEN would recommend different products based on the userâ€™s choice. Project levels include:
  - Gardening: For a smaller project, users may just want to drag and drop flora or fauna and smaller outdoor decor into their pre-existing space. 
  - Landscaping: For large projects, users that want to grade (reshape) the land have the option to cut (remove land) and fill (add land) in the app. GARDEN would recommend plants, bigger outdoor decor as well as other heavy duty products to the user. 
  - General Contracting: Can use the app to plan/design a blueprint of the area to determine if it is feasible. 
  - Freelancing: Can use it for any DIY projects or personal business projects
